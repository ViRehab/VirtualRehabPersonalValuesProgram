# Virtual Rehab Personal Values Program

This repository contains one of the Virtual Rehab programs which focuses on definining a user/patient's personal values.

The program commences with a training session for those who are unfamiliar with the use of Virtual Reality.

After successfully completing the training session, the user is guided through the complete experience, which focuses, as mentioned earlier, on defining the user's personal values along with the user's priorities in life.

A point and a reward system is allocated based on the user's responses, selections, and activity.

Note that, as per medical recommendation, it is not advised that this program is used for longer than 30 minutes to avoid any potential hallucination or feeling of nauseousness.

Should you have any questions, kindly do not hesitate to reach out to the Virtual Rehab team at contact@virtualrehab.co

All other programs are to remain private as they will be used for commercial purposes and most are prorpietory to our clients.

Virtual Rehab's all-encompassing solution covers the following pillars:

- Virtual Reality - A virtual simulation of the real world using cognitive behavior and exposure therapy to trigger and to cope with temptations

-	Allows users to order and download programs from Virtual Rehab Online Portal
